<h2>An Italian staple made out of alternating layers of pasta, cheese and meaty tomato sauce.</h2>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Red Sauce</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by sealing the meat in a large pan with the cooking oil, on high heat.</li>
        <li>When the desired level of brownness is achieved add the diced carrots, celery and onions.</li>
        <li>Reduce the pan to a low heat and add the garlic.</li>
        <li>Add the canned tomatoes along with the same measurement of the can in water.</li>
        <li>Let simmer for about two hours, add herbs and correct the salt and pepper if needed.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Bechamél Sauce</li>

    <ol start="6">
        <li>In a medium sized pan add the butter.</li>
        <li>When it starts to get a bit brown add in three to four teaspoons of flour. Stir until the flour itself
            starts to brown too.
        </li>
        <li>Start adding the milk little by little, always stirring. Correct salt and pepper if needed. When it develops
            a rich purée looking appearance it is ready,
        </li>
    </ol>
    <li>Assembly</li>
    <ol start="9">
        <li>In an oven-ready tray add the red sauce, pasta, bechamél sauce and mozzarella in this order.</li>
        <li>Repeat as many layers as needed.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven at low-medium heat until golden.</li>
        <li>Decorate with more herbs or Parmesan cheese.</li>


    </ol>


</ul>
<h3><i>Tips</i></h3>
<ul>
    <li>You can make both sauces in this recipe in batches for freezing and future use.</li>
    <li>For really stacked lasagnas it might be a good idea to bake them covered in tin foil to ensure proper cooking before browning.</li>
    <li>Let it cool for about 30 minutes before slicing, the sauce will adhere better to the pasta while it cools.</li>

</ul>
